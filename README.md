Personal Website & Portfolio
=========

This is my website and portfolio of recent projects.



Structure
=========

I built this website with HTML/CSS using Bootstrap and Sass with Compass along with some JavaScript.

The first version included non-modular sass. It's since been modularized according to the SMACSS (https://smacss.com/) methodology.

Because this isn't a large scale project, I relied on nesting for styling elements. If this were a larger project requiring more scalability, I would have used a class naming methodology rather than sass nesting.
