Personal Website & Portfolio
=========

This is my website and portfolio of recent projects.



Structure
=========

I built this website with HTML/CSS using Bootstrap and Sass.

The first version included non-modular sass. It's since been modularized according to the SMACSS (https://smacss.com/) methodology.
